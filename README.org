#+title: A virtual radio DJ for beets

The beets-vrdj package provides two plugins, currently named after the
technology they use:

- =vggish= :: calculate and store VGGish embeddings for songs
- =faiss= :: process embeddings and store and query them in an FAISS vector db

Besides commands matching these plugin names the =faiss= plug provides the command

- vrdj :: virtual radio DJ takes a beets query, aggregates the vectors from its items to form a faiss query and then produces a list of songs that are most "similar".

tbd:
- [ ] improve output of vrdj to write m3u on request, provide file name.
- [ ] improve output of vrdj so it works like =beet ls=, if possible?
- [ ] install story
- [ ] usage examples
- [ ] alternative vectorize (vector distance instead of cosine?)
- [ ] alternative embeddings (openl3?)
- [ ] move beets ID <--> faiss ID map from JSON sidecar to FAISS db and into beets DB
